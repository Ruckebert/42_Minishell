!!HANDLE $ sign

1)
How do i recognize if something is a flag or should be part of the word?
example:
echo -m "test"
gives me -m test because -m is not a flag for echo.
example2:
echo -n "test" | cat -m 
gives me an error because -m doesnt exist

CHECK ACCESS COMMAND FOR THIS

2)
Tokenizing not correct for <<, >> and =something because i tokenize special chars as single chars and need to pull them together and change the type.

incomplete list, duuh.

3) implement escape char
